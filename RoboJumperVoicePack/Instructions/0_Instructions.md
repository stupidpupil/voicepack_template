# $ModSafeName$ - How to edit this mod

This mod template is setup to make it easy to create a voicepack for a single new voice, 
using Robojumper's voice script.

As part of this it uses specific naming conventions for different parts of the mod - when 
the instructions tell you to name something in a particular way generally you must follow 
them exactly or else the mod will not work. (Quotation marks are NOT part of names.)

The instructions for this mod template try to be very thorough - it's quite wordy in 
the process.  There are some other tutorials given in the Credits section which you might 
find helpful although they are not as specific to this template. 

This instructions folder has the following chapters
 - Setting up the package (creating a barebones UPK file to start adding SoundCues and sound files to)
 - Adding your first bark (adding a sound file to the package and hooking it up Robojumper's script via a sound cue)
 - Notes on sound files (what formats are required, etc.)
 - Customising details of the mod (gender restrictions, voice name)
 - Credits
