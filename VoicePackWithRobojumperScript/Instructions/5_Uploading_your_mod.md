# Uploading to the workshop

The [Alternative Mod Uploader](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1134322341), 
also by Robojumper, is easier to use than the one built into ModBuddy.

These instructions below are highly opinionated and reflect my personal preferences! 
You can ignore them if you like.

## Name of the mod

I suggest that you call your voice pack something like 
**Cerys (Witcher 3) - Voice [Vanilla/WOTC]**.

In some parts of the workshop, the name will be cut down to only the 
first 30 characters or so (e.g. 'Cerys (Witcher 3) - Voice [Va…'), so you
want the character name (and source material, if relevant) at the very start.

Compatibility details are helpful, but they don't need to be at the front. (Many
people have WOTC and most voice packs are compatible with both vanilla and WOTC
(even if many show a warning for WOTC).

You should point out it adds a voice somewhere in the title, but adding 'pack' is pointless,
and again it doesn't need to be at the front.

## Description
I think the following information is useful:
 * How many unique lines does the voice pack include? (Doesn't need to be precise. '100+', for example.)
 * What gender and language is associated with the voice?
 * Is the voice enabled for WOTC faction characters, Sparks etc.?
 * Is the voice XCOM-lore-friendly? (Does it mention characters or concepts from elsewhere?)

I also think it's polite to give a little info about where the lines came from, and who the voice actor was.

I would be grateful if you could provide a link to this voice pack template. For example:
```
This voice pack was created using [url=https://github.com/stupidpupil/voicepack_template]StupidPupil's template for Robojumper's script[/url].
```
but it's obviously your choice!

## Images and videos

*Preview* images (which appear as the square images in the workshop) 
should be 256x256 pixels. I don't think you need to add prominent *XCOM 2* or *WOTC* 
logos to your preview image since mostly people will find your mod by looking at the *XCOM 2* workshop.

Preview videos are helpful, particularly if they show some actual gameplay
(and not just you hitting the *PREVIEW* button in the customisation screen).

[Shotcut](https://shotcut.org) is a fairly easy-to-use video editor.

## Tagging
Use the *Voice* tag and *War Of The Chosen* tags. (The first so that people can
find it when looking for voice packs, and the second so that people can easily
see that it should be compatible with WOTC.)

Please don't use the *Soldier Customisation* tag (etc.) - this is mostly used
by people adding visual customisation ('cosmetics' - e.g. armour, clothes, hair) and it makes
it easier for people browsing the workshop if we don't stick voice packs in there too.
