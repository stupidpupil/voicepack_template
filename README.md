# Voice Pack Template

This is an XCOM 2 ModBuddy template for creating voice pack mods, using Robojumper's voice script and drawing heavily on [Kregano's tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1asHlhTP9tJzyKXIwDALpWdJTVasjh-72blST9kQeai8).

# Features

- Supports more XCOM 2 and WotC voice cues (and custom cues for use with other mods)
- Avoids the use of VoiceBanks (Thanks to Robojumper)
- Can provide in-game popup messages to help debug when events occur (Thanks to Robojumper)
- Prepopulates `Config\XComContent.ini` and `Localization\XComGame.int`
- Tells you clearly how to setup and name content in the mod's UPK
- Avoids producing a shader cache when rebuilding
