# RoboJumper Voice Pack Template

This is an XCOM 2 ModBuddy template for creating voice pack mods based on RoboJumper's voice script. (RoboJumper's script fixes a number of problems with the built-in voice bank mechanism.)

It provides a naming convention for the relevant parts of a voice pack mod, and prepopulates much of the mod with the correct names and provides clear instructions for the bits you have to do yourself.
